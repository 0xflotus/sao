# Share Your Generator

To share your generator with others, you can push your repo to GitHub or to any gist provider that is supported by SAO. It's recommended to create a repo following the `sao-*` naming convention.

However, it's recommeneded to publish your generator on npm too.

📝 __package.json__:

```json
{
  "name": "sao-foo",
  "files": [
    "saofile.js",
    "template"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "sao-generator",
    "sao",
    "scaffolding"
  ]
}
```
